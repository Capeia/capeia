                There is no strict rule as to the required number of articles per month. Obviously, the more articles the better, but the number of articles should not come at a cost to their quality. Typically, 1 - 2 good quality articles per month of about 500 words should be fine to keep the public interest for your personal site up.

                Yes, the author and scientist will be charged a 6.5% commission on all donations received. The commission will be used to cover management and maintenance costs for the site and to finance further development of the platform. In addition, the financial services providers usually charge a 1.0 – 1.5% handling fee, depending on the credit card used for the transaction.

                Do I get my money back if a project does not develop as expected?

                  Short answer: No.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More elaborate answer: Rather than promoting specific research projects on Capeia we offer our scientists a forum in which to present their ongoing research activities. We understand that research is a highly dynamic process that needs a lot of creative freedom to flourish and for this reason our scientists do not have projects that are pre-defined in great detail or have to be completed within a specified time frame. Instead we advocate “continuous funding for continuous research”. The more funding a scientist can raise the more quickly the research will be able to progress. Every cent of support is therefore valuable and makes a real difference.

              <p>
                The donor’s name and address are only included in the list of donations with the donor’s explicit consent. Otherwise, the donation is listed as “anonymous”.

              <p>
                If a research activity is terminated for unforeseeable (and presumably rather sad) reasons, the residual balance is placed at the disposal of the research institution involved.

                Since we don’t promote specific research projects but rather offer our scientists a forum in which to present their ongoing research activities, there is no specific time limit for a scientist’s registration on Capeia. It does make a lot of sense, however, to routinely update one’s research activities and provide potential sponsors with an overview of future research plans.

                Capeia not only seeks to stimulate discussion but is also committed to spreading the information and ideas that are expressed on this website into the depths of the World Wide Web. So much so that we provide an extra crowdfunding scheme to collect funds with which to provide a reward on a monthly basis for the scientist whose contribution attracts the most attention. Read an article and then comment on it or share it via one of our media interfaces and you will promote its author for this prize. Every such activity generates points for an article and whichever author receives the most points over any particular month becomes the

                ; the money collected in the prize pool is then paid into his or her research account. For transparency, the score of each article is indicated as it develops over time; a high score indicates that an article is in high demand and/or shared eagerly within the community. A registered author’s total score (i.e. the points for all of his or her articles) is shown on the author’s personal site.
