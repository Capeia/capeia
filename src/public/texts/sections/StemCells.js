      Each one of us started out as a single cell.
      This cell, known as a zygote, eventually grew to the approximately 100 trillion cells that, on average, make up an adult human body, with each of these cells having a defined form and function.
      Some cells in the body, however, do not differentiate terminally; they retain a less specific form and do not serve any specific function.
      They are called adult stem cells.
      Their hallmark is their ability to renew themselves through repeated rounds of cell division and to differentiate into the particular cell type that the tissue or organ they reside in is made of.
      Adult stem cells can thus be viewed as a source of spare cells that is available for most of the body’s cell types.
      Notable exceptions are many neurons and the fiber cells of the eye lens: these cells function over a person’s entire lifespan and cannot be replaced once lost or damaged.
      For most other cell types, however, populations of stem cells exist that are thought to compensate for losses due to normal wear and tear, injury, or disease.
      Erythrocytes, for instance, have a lifespan of about 100 to 120 days; without constant replenishment by hematopoietic stem cells, the human body would run out of red blood cells and die after four months at the latest.
      As appealing as this concept of self-repair and renewal may sound, it has significant limitations.
      First of all, stem cells age and their potency for self-renewal and differentiation declines markedly over a human lifespan.
      Secondly, stem cells are unable to compensate for major cell losses that occur after a severe stroke or myocardial infarction, let alone the loss of an extremity such as a leg or an arm.
      Axolotls, however, can regrow an amputated leg thanks to their unique stem cells and it would be nice if we could coax our stem cells to achieve that too.
