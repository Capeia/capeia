      Rhinoceroses (or rhinos) belong to the order of odd-toed ungulates (perissodactyls) that comprise, apart from the rhinos, the tapirs and equids (horses, donkeys, and zebras).
      Odd-toed ungulates had their prime time 20 – 30 million years ago before the even-toed ungulates (artiodactyls; cattle, deer, gazelles, etc.) rose to prominence.
      The reason for this shift in taxon diversity was presumably the evolution in artiodactyls of a complex stomach that allowed more efficient utilization of low-nutrient food.
      The decline of odd-toed ungulates accelerated over the last ice ages and only 17 species are left today (compared to about 220 even-toed ungulates), including 5 species of rhino.
      Three of these five rhino species are critically endangered with the Javan rhinoceros, <em>Rhinoceros sondaicus</em>, possibly being the rarest mammal on earth.
      This species is down to a relic population of about 50 – 60 individuals in the Ujung Kulon National Park, at the very western tip of the island of Java.
      Unlike deer, rhinos do not flee nervously when approached but rather stand their ground, so watch out when travelling along remote forest roads in Africa or SE Asia!
