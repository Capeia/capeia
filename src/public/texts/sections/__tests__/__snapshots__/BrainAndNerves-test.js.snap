    , as it is known, is a small 1 mm nematode that lives in soil and is a favourite model organism of developmental biologists and neuroscientists. It is one of the simplest animals with a nervous system. In the common hermaphrodite form it boasts 302 neurons, which is nearly one third of its total cell count of 959. This may seem a far cry from a human’s estimated 85 billion neurons but those 302 nerve cells are sufficient to endow the creature with a diverse behavioural repertoire that includes oriented movement, feeding, mating, and an escape reaction from predacious fungi. Not only is the worm’s exact number of neurons known but also its precise wiring diagram, the connectome. This neuronal map, the worm’s mind, if you like, has recently been uploaded by the
