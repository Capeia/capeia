    Cancer is a reminder of our unicellular origin. Once life had arisen on Earth about 3.8 billion years ago the primordial life forms competed for sparse resources and, in the 
    <em>
      “struggle for existence”
    </em>
    , only those that were able to outcompete others prevailed, ultimately through sheer weight of numbers. A simple and brutal scenario, as it would seem, and it apparently took more than 2 billion years before something extraordinary happened and instead of competing some cells started to cooperate with each other, eventually forming the first multicellular organisms. The hallmark of multicellularity is cellular altruism which means that most of an organism’s cells do not propagate themselves but rather support germ cells, which alone have a chance to give rise to the next generation. In order to achieve this reproductive self-restriction, after billions of years of selection for maximal cell replication, a highly sophisticated system of checks and balances had to evolve that would keep the individual cells of our bodies under Darwinian control. Alas, one hundred percent reliability does not exist, and mutations that occur in our cells can compromise this safeguard system. With time, one checkpoint after the other may break down allowing affected cells to abandon self-restriction and selfishly propagate at the expense of the whole organism. Cancer may thus be viewed as a relapse to our unicellular past. Exploring the molecular details of how cancer cells evolve in our body and conceiving countermeasures is a truly Herculean task. Effective cures (with an average 5-year survival rate of 90% or more) have to date only been found for a small number of non-final stage cancers, including Hodgkin’s lymphoma, testicular cancer, and thyroid cancer. Clearly, our research efforts have to continue.
