            Our authors are all active scientists involved in competitive research and are specialists in their own field. We do not adopt text from news agencies or other media. Each article is a genuine original contribution that draws on the author‚Äôs critical faculty and experience accumulated over a career in academic research.
          </p>
          <p>
            Articles published on Capeia reflect the dynamic nature of science, placing a focus not only on its great moments but also on its pitfalls, ambiguities and uncertainties. Today‚Äôs scientific industry churns out, at least initially, vast quantities of data that are in desperate need of interpretation and discussion before any new knowledge can be achieved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Capeia is committed to improving our understanding of scientific matters by picking up interesting pieces of information from different sources, including research publications, media reports, book releases, and conferences, and commenting on them in a critical manner that can be easily understood by non-experts.

            Every scientist registered on Capeia is provided with a forum in which to present his or her research, together with the opportunity to receive funding from the community. On Capeia, however, there is no need for scientists to run a frantic online campaign that may or may not yield a pre-defined amount of funding. We believe that our scientists should devote their energy to what they do best: advancing their field of research and sharing their thoughts and reflections with the rest of us. On Capeia, financial support for scientists is provided on a ‚Äúcontinuous funding for continuous research‚Äù basis. The more funding a scientist receives the more he or she can advance in his or her field by recruiting students, buying cool equipment, or having expensive analyses carried out. This funding scheme means that money once donated won‚Äôt come back to you, so better think carefully before pressing the support button üòâ. All donations, minus a fee for expenses involved in maintaining and running the platform, are paid into an account held by the scientist's institute. From there, the money gets routed directly to the scientist's research account.
